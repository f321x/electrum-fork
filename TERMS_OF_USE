# Terms of Use

* Electrum	is distributed under the MIT licence by Electrum
  Technologies GmbH. Most notably, this means that the Electrum
  software is provided as is, and that it comes without warranty.

* We are neither bank nor a financial service provider. In
  addition, we do not not store user account data, and we are not
  an intermediary in the interaction between our software and the
  Bitcoin blockchain. Therefore, we do not have the possibility to
  freeze funds or to undo a fraudulent transaction.

* We do not provide private user support. All issue resolutions
  are public, and take place on Github or public forums. If
  someone posing as 'Electrum support' proposes to help you via a
  private channel, this person is most likely an imposter trying
  to steal your bitcoins.
